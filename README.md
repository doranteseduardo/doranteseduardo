I build mobile and AR/VR applications with a focus on democratizing immersive technology through open source. At ReactVision, I revived and modernized ViroReact—now with over 70,000 downloads this year—extending support for the latest React Native architecture.

My work spans Swift, Kotlin, TypeScript, and C++ across iOS, Android, and cross-platform development.
